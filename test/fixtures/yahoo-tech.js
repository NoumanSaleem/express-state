Weird And Wacky Gadgets of CES 2014","summary":"Behold the wildest and wackiest products at CES 2014. We’re talking about projectors on wheels, iPhone tasers, and high-tech thighmasters. We even found a 3D food printer. Check out the full list here.","body":"<p>By Michael A. Prospero\n</p><p>While the biggest trends at this year’s CES were wearables, curved TVs and smarter homes and cars, there was plenty of room in Las Vegas for wonderfully weird gizmos. We’re talking about projectors on wheels, iPhone tasers, and high-tech thighmasters. We even found a 3D food printer. Behold the wildest and wackiest products at CES 2014.</p> \n<p><strong>Sen.se Mother</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/wUNa9Mi3BGACy3OVXZ9-Mvj_iWo\"></strong></p> \n<p>Even Joan Crawford wasn’t this creepy. The Sen.se Mother connects to your home network and keeps track of what you eat, steps you take and where your kids are, all the while looking at you with its green glowing eyes. The Mother is available for preorder for $222, and is expected to ship in February.</p> \n<p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/worst-gadget-flops-of-all-time\">25 Worst Gadget Flops of All Time</a></p> \n<p><strong>Yellow Jacket iPhone Taser Case</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/HXwYMr8gIPrqxW6yIP2_d9Z1kkk\"></strong></p> \n<p>This one’s all the buzz. Built into this unassuming iPhone case is a taser that delivers 650,000 volts to any would-be assailant. Set to launch in February, it will cost $149. Just make sure they’re legal where you live.</p> \n<p><strong>TrewGrip Keyboard</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/Gknkkj2Qb8WxE5Uon5IYNqC_owA\"></strong></p> \n<p>The keyboard for aspiring accordion players, the TrewGrip is a Bluetooth keyboard that attaches to your smartphone or small tablet, but has its keys on the backside, making you type by feel. According to the company, the reach-around TrewGrip is more ergonomic and allows for faster typing than a traditional keyboard. That may be, but we might stick with Ryan Seacrest’s Typo case.</p> \n<p><strong>Touchscreen-Friendly Elektra Nails</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/465sIg0dj-ySDXRpz0aY3XJayoc\"></strong></p> \n<p>Ladies, don’t you just hate it when your fingernails get in the way of your smartphone? Elektra’s glue-on nails can be detected by a touchscreen display, letting you type messages with stylus-like accuracy. Even better, you can paint them any color you choose. Take that, Lee press-ons!</p> \n<p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/best-ces-2014-awards\">Best of CES 2014 Awards</a></p> \n<p><strong>Singing, Dancing Plush Obama Doll</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/nwLjeN0z20Tlyh3dP5tmAqXbt3M\"></strong></p> \n<p><em>(Image: intomobile.com)</em></p> \n<p>Meet the gift for the tea partier who has everything. Plug Barack into a phone or other music device, and watch him dance and sing your favorite tunes. Better, this toy made by Plush Pals can also be used as a speakerphone, giving new meaning to the phrase “the President’s on the line.”</p> \n<p><strong>Kooky Keecker Projector on Wheels</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/CqymaVBTl0CL2gZvju4VamIX4Nk\"></strong></p> \n<p>Now why didn’t we think of this? The Kooky Keecker is a 1080p projector on wheels, so you can take your shows wherever you go. Not only can you watch movies using this $5,000 projector, but you can also play games, as it runs Android 4.2. You can drive this gadget around using an Android app, or even have it automatically follow you. That’s one way to cast a huge shadow.</p> \n<p><strong>Inmotion SCV Personal Transporter</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/6eCTS3uF6EHkef6AEgDuRemlkQI\"></strong></p> \n<p>The Segway never caught on, but that hasn’t stopped others from trying. Inmotion’s SCV R1 personal transporter is about half the size and half the price of Steve Wozniak’s preferred mode of transportation, and we dig the Lamborghini-style tail lights. We had such a fun time wheeling around on the SCV, we didn’t want to stop.</p> \n<p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/apple-iphone-6-features\">iPhone 6 Features: What We Want From Apple</a></p> \n<p><strong>Tao WellShell</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/73-oDgUolnRQ7VZ5kLvOYYWpX3o\"></strong></p> \n<p>Pay attention, Suzanne Somers. Keep your thighs toned by squeezing the Tao WellShell between your hands or legs; this squishable fitness gadget measures the force of your press, and records it on a smartphone app. Unlike the ThighMaster of old, the WellShell is much more portable, and can be used for a number of different isometric exercises.</p> \n<p><strong>ChefJet 3D Food Printer</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/79fkIJH_44xzUKtPvniEC5yTvlQ\"></strong></p> \n<p>Cooking your own food is so last year. 3D System’s ChefJet is a printer that can create edible three-dimensional objects out of sugar, from candy and cake toppings to decorations and pretty much anything you can make on a 3D printer. But before you let all that sugar rush to your head, know that the ChefJet costs $5,000.</p> \n<p><strong>PrioVR Gaming Body Suit</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/_RXjIexq-m8KHwNl152Rc89hgfQ\"></strong></p> \n<p><em>(Image: tomsguide.com)</em></p> \n<p>Resistance is futile. Once you strap into Yei Technology’s full-body Prio Virtual Reality gaming accessory, your PlayStation 4 controller will seem like an Atari joystick. That’s because this suit, which covers your arms and legs, translates your movements into whatever character you’re playing in a game, making for a much more immersive experience. The cost of this awesomeness? $499.</p> \n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/gadgets-ahead-of-their-time\">12 Gadgets Ahead of Their Time</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/10-killer-features-for-apple%E2%80%99s-iwatch\">Apples iWatch: 10 Killer Features</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/biggest-gadget-design-fails\">10 Biggest Gadget Design Fails</a></li> \n</ul>\n<p><em>Copyright 2014&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.laptopmag.com/\">LAPTOP Magazine</a>, a TechMediaNetwork company.

People in the tech industry have been talking about the “IoT” \n","body":"<p>In the lead up to CES, much of the buzz centered on &ldquo;The Internet of Things.&rdquo; David Pogue and I sat down to discuss all the CES news, and why the Internet of Things (IoT) is actually the Worst Term Ever (WTE).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The term Internet of Things originated in an <a href=\"http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986\">engineering journal</a> back in 2009 but Bill Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, might get points for the idea and in hindsight had a better name: D2D communication. No actually that name is not better. But the concept is a little clearer: device-to-device communication.</p>\n<p>The idea is that your smartphone or computer can communicate with Internet connected gadgets. It&rsquo;s a way to monitor and quantify what&rsquo;s happening in your home, unify standards for controlling an automated house, and as David Pogue points out, turn the thermostat down remotely when your kids have the heat turned up too high, &ldquo;Put on a damn sweater.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While the concept has been around for a while, the idea has really gained traction in the last few years. Primarily smartphone adoption has gone up and WiFi in the home has reached a tipping point. We have the Philips connected light bulbs that can be dimmed or put on a timer by app. Sonos, Bose, and Samsung can wirelessly stream music though your home. And the Nest connected thermostat lets my co-host chill his children while he&rsquo;s here in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>At CES we saw refrigerators that can text you, robotic vacuum cleaners you can fire up remotely when you&rsquo;re on your way home, and a dog collar that texts you its location when your four-legged friend runs away.</p>\n<p>But all of these devices use separate apps; it&rsquo;s a splintered process to control the IoT (WTE- worst term ever) connected home right now. So one device that got a lot of praise this week was the <a href=\"http://revolv.com/\">Revolv Smart Home hub</a>. It takes all these connected devices and lets you control them through one app. Good idea, we&rsquo;ll see if it creates any unification or standards amongst the new players in devices that communicate with us.</p>\n<p>Yahoo Tech Columnist Dan Tynan wrote a <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/tech/the-internet-of-things-is-coming-to-your-home-your-72780133945.html\">great explanation</a> of how the Internet of Things could work.&nbsp; But we still really need a better name: Tweet me your ideas &ndash; I&rsquo;m @bworley on Twitter.</p>\n<p>You can also see the full &ldquo;PogueCast&rdquo; <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/poguecast-%E2%80%93-totally-unscripted-020718044.html\">here</a>.</p>","videos":[{"width":250,"height":140,"embed":"<iframe src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/upgrade-dumbest-tech-term-ever-153439795.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false\" width=\"250\" height=\"140\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>"},{"width":400,"height":225,"embed":"<iframe src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/upgrade-dumbest-tech-term-ever-153439795.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>"},{"width":500,"height":281,"embed":"<iframe src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/upgrade-dumbest-tech-term-ever-153439795.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>"}],"leadImages":[{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":98,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":112,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":140,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":168,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":196,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":224,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":252,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w500/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":280,"size_type":"500"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w550/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":550,"height":309,"size_type":"550"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w600/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":337,"size_type":"600"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w640/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":640,"height":359,"size_type":"original"}],"lead_image":{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w640/b492ffc462386f274793595d325b0ecbd6f4897d","type":"image/jpeg","width":640,"height":359,"size_type":"original"}},{"id":"72806816260","magazine":"tech","priority":"normal","palette":["#d60310","#d8121f","#d31225","#fefefe","#e2e2e3"],"author":{"id":"alyssabereznak","name":"Alyssa Bereznak","title":"Tech Columnist","bio":"Alyssa Bereznak is a professional internet user with over 10 years of experience, some of which were spent at Vanity Fair.

LG’s Lifeband Touch, revealed this week at CES, pairs with special biometric earbuds to do just that.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/7m9le552rJIYGNDf0QHw3tia1p0\"></p> \n<p>Here’s how it works:</p> \n<p>Before you go running, you can tailor your exercise routine on a separate app that communicates with the Lifeband. So, say it’s your goal to run four miles along your favorite scenic beach every day.&nbsp;You enter that information into the app, and then, as you run, the band communicates your distance and location to the app via Bluetooth. All the while the earbuds use a special&nbsp;sensor to measure the blood flow in your ear, and can also monitor your oxygen intake — a useful stat if you’re training for a big run.</p> \n<p>LG says the headphones aren’t quite ready to be plugged into devices yet, so I wasn’t able to test their sound. But they fit comfortably on the ear, keeping the speaker secure with little wrap-around wings.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/zmBb4NNn0E87For03l8H-cepsl4\"></p> \n<p>As for the design of the band itself? Aesthetically, it’s nothing special. Just that same discreet black bracelet that, thanks to the Nike FuelBand, is nearly ubiquitous for “smart” exercise accessories. It fits comfortably on the wrist, and comes in small, medium, and large. What’s different, however, is you’re able to swipe through your stats on an OLED touchscreen with your finger to see how many calories you’ve burned, miles you’ve walked, steps you’ve taken—the works.</p> \n<p> At first try, the touch screen was nice and responsive, but I’d need more time with it to be convinced of LG’s claim that it also reliably turns on when you move your wrist to look at it.&nbsp;<br></p> \n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/80E8NgkR2DtfwyK5ePhwSY-B5fk\"></p> \n<p>The band’s battery lasts for two to five days, depending how much of a gym rat you are, and the app that comes along works with both Android and iOS. It should be available this spring, but LG hasn’t decide how much it’ll cost us yet.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It would’ve been nice to try out the headphones with the band so I could test the sound and accuracy. But I’m definitely going to keep my eye on this one.</p>","leadImages":[{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":161,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":184,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":230,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":276,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":322,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":369,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":415,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w483/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":483,"height":445,"size_type":"original"}],"lead_image":{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w483/307f405240c3ef317bce08abdc19158ff4208059","type":"image/jpeg","width":483,"height":445,"size_type":"original"}},{"id":"72885659660","magazine":"tech","priority":"normal","palette":["#f8b64c","#3074d1","#fefefe","#a9c3e7","#6e9bd3"],"author":{"id":"rwyahoo","name":"Rob Walker","title":"Tech Columnist","bio":"Rob Walker is a technology and culture columnist for Yahoo News.

Or a 'Tech-Averse Older'?","summary":"Gallup released a new analysis lumping American adults into four types of gadget owners: super tech adopters, smartphone reliants, mature technopiles and tech-averse olders. Which one are you?","body":"<p><em><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/r7jX6NS1uSZIIhsjyS6j30_St9M\"></em></p> \n<p><em>(Image: thenextweb.com)</em></p> \n<p>If you have Wi-Fi, a laptop and a DVD player in your home, but no smartphone, then you might be considered a “mature technophile.”</p> \n<p>To coincide with the International&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.laptopmag.com/l/ces.aspx\">Consumer Electronics Show</a>&nbsp;in Las Vegas this week, Gallup released a new analysis lumping American adults into four types of gadget owners: super tech adopters, smartphone reliants, mature technopiles and tech-averse olders.</p> \n<p>At one extreme, super tech adopters, who apparently make up 31 percent of the U.S. population, are relatively young, well off, educated and the most likely to own a wide array of electronics. [<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/38795-9-odd-tech-injuries.html\">9 Odd Ways Your Tech Devices May Injure You</a>]</p> \n<p>While 62 percent of Americans overall own a smartphone, 100 percent of super tech adopters have one. Virtually all super tech adopters (99 percent) also have wireless Internet at home, 95 percent have a laptop, 78 percent own a tablet and 68 percent subscribe to a streaming service like Netflix, Gallup found. The group is the youngest, with an average age of 39, and the majority (53 percent) earn $75,000 or more annually, while only 12 percent earn less than $30,000.</p> \n<p>Another 19 percent of Americans are considered smartphone reliants. They’re nearly just as likely to own a smartphone as super tech adopters (93 percent), but they’re less likely to have other tech at home; just 65 percent own a laptop and 21 percent own a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tablets-review.toptenreviews.com/?cmpid=ttr-ls\">tablet</a>, for example. While most other groups were pretty evenly split in terms of gender, a majority of smartphone reliants are women (58 percent). Only about a quarter (27 percent) have graduated college; about half (48 percent) are employed; and 46 percent earn between $30,000 and $75,000 each year.</p> \n<p>Mature technopiles, like super tech adopters, report higher ownership of home electronics, such as desktop and laptop computers, tablets,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ebook-reader-review.toptenreviews.com/?cmpid=ttr-ls\">E-readers</a>&nbsp;and DVD or Blu-ray devices. However, these 22 percent of Americans are less likely to have made the jump from a basic cellphone to a smartphone, which might be explained by the fact that this group tends to be older (average age 50), according to Gallup.</p> \n<p>With an average age of 58, tech-averse olders — as the name gives away — have low ownership rates of electronics across the board. Making up 28 percent of the U.S. population, just 16 percent have a smartphone and only 20 percent have wireless Internet in their homes. The gadgets they are most likely to own are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dvd-player-software-review.toptenreviews.com/?cmpid=ttr-ls\">DVD players</a>&nbsp;(63 percent) and VCRs (60 percent), Gallup’s analysis shows. But age may not be the only barrier keeping tech-averse olders from using more electronics: Most (56 percent) make less than $30,000 per year and two-thirds (68 percent) did not attend college.</p> \n<p>Gallup officials say the results highlight some major electronics disparities in the United States, some of which could be explained by income or age. The pollsters say these gaps could affect how people across different tech-user types interact socially, stay informed and spend their time, as well as how they receive messages from political officials and advertisers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/166760/three-own-array-consumer-electronics.aspx\">Gallup’s analysis</a>&nbsp;is based on the group’s 2013 Lifestyle survey, in which 1,031 adults across the nation were interviewed between Dec. 5 and 8, 2013.</p> \n<p><em>Follow Megan Gannon on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/meganigannon\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112479001617280513600/posts\"><em>Google+.</em></a>&nbsp;<em>Follow us&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveScience\"><em>@livescience</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/livescience\"><em>Facebook</em></a>&nbsp;<em>&amp;&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/101164570444913213957/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.

According to his findings, 15 percent of teens admitted to online gambling once a week so he’s pushing for schools to create classes warning them of the dangers of online gambling.</p> \n<p>&quot;Teachers should start talking about these sorts of things,&quot; he said. &quot;I don’t want to come across as an omen of doom.

Has Seemingly Made It Easier For Strangers To Send You Email","summary":"A new Gmail setting lets you choose whether you want people to be able to send an email to your Google+ profile — even if they don’t have your email address in their contacts. The four options let you control whether any Google+ user, or just people in your circles or extended circles can email you. You can also disable the feature by selecting “no one.” (via The Verge)","body":"<p><img src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/sF5huVIO4XuelZqGBdGR7MFS3tU\"></p> \n<p>A new feature in Google Inc’s Gmail will result in some users receiving messages from people with whom they have not shared their email addresses, raising concerns among some privacy advocates.</p> \n<p>The change, which Google announced on Thursday, broadens the list of contacts available to Gmail users so it includes both the email addresses of their existing contacts, as well as the names of people on the Google+ social network. As a result, a person can send an email directly to friends, and strangers, who use Google+.</p> \n<p>Google is increasingly trying to integrate its Google+, a two-and-a-half-year old social network that has 540 million active users, with its other services. When consumers sign up for Gmail, the company’s Web-based email service, they are now automatically given a Google+ account.</p> \n<p>Google said the new feature will make it easier for people who use both services to communicate with their friends.</p> \n<p>&quot;Have you ever started typing an email to someone only to realize halfway through the draft that you haven’t actually exchanged email addresses?&quot; the company said in a blog post announcing the feature. &quot;You’re in luck, because now it’s easier for people using Gmail and Google+ to connect over email.&quot;</p> \n<p>Google said that users who did not wish to receive email messages from other people on Google+ could switch the settings so that they receive messages only from people they have added to their networks of friends or from no one at all.</p> \n<p>Some privacy advocates said Google should have made the new feature “opt-in,” meaning that users should explicitly agree to receive messages from other Google+ users, rather than being required to manually change the setting.</p> \n<p>Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of non-profit Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the new feature “troubling.”</p> \n<p>&quot;There is a strong echo of the Google Buzz snafu,&quot; he said, referring to a social networking service that Google launched in 2010. Buzz initially used its Gmail users’ contact lists to create social networks that the rest of the world could see, leading to an uproar and ultimately a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p> \n<p><em><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/ejDULsrGFNRxMBvtkp9Zje27CC8\"></em></p> \n<p><em>(Image: The Verge)</em></p> \n<p>Google said the new feature would not expose the email addresses of any Google+ users to strangers. Emails from strangers on Google+ will be routed to a special section within the recipients mailbox that is separate from messages from friends and other contacts. If the recipient does not reply to the message, Gmail will block any future messages from that person.</p> \n<p>A Google spokeswoman said the company planned to send an email to all Google+ users during the next two days alerting them to the change and explaining how to change their settings.</p> \n<p>One exception to the new feature is celebrities on Google+, who are followed by a large number of fans. According to the spokeswoman, the Gmail accounts of such public figures will not automatically receive emails from other Google+ users.</p> \n<p><em>(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic.

Now whenever you’re connected to these WiFi networks, the app will know to disable that pesky password protection.</p> \n<p>Voila! You’re free!</p> \n<p>SkipLock will also work in a similar way for on-the-go use via your phone’s Bluetooth.

Just go into the <strong>Settings</strong> menu of your smartphone while you’re connected to a designated WiFi or Bluetooth profile and in “Device unlocked” mode, navigate to <strong>Security &gt; Screen Lock</strong> and select <strong>None</strong>.</p> \n<p>SkipLock is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benhirashima.skiplock\">available now in the Play store</a> as a free 4 day trial.

They soon realized that, with a few modifications, the printers could print sugary creations that were safe to eat.</p> \n<p>After a few months experimenting with materials, the Von Hasselns figured out a few different flavored mixtures that were both structurally sound and extremely tasty. They opened Sugar Lab, a company where people could order 3D printed sugary creations. Soon after 3DSystems contacted them with an offer to buy the company and turn their modified Cube printers into their own line: the ChefJet and the ChefJetPro.</p> \n<p>With one of these machines, you don’t need a steady hand to create sugary masterpieces anymore — all it takes is a vision and some time with a computer-aided design (CAD) program to create a digital model you like.</p> \n<p>If you’d rather not design from scratch, the printers come with a “recipe book” of ready-to-print designs called “The Digital Cookbook.”&nbsp; 3DSystems’ own online community and marketplace, Cubify, is also a good place to start looking for models. Once you get a design you like, instead of painstakingly recreating it every time you bake, all you have to do is send it to the ChefJet printer and it’ll print the design for you.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/P9F3Kfo0yt40ptO0cwdXE8g8lWY\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/ces-2014/2014/1/7/5285628/3d-systems-chefjet-pro-sweet-3d-printer-candy-hands-on\"><em>Photo via The Verge</em></a>.</p> \n<p>However, the ChefJet isn’t exactly a consumer must-have. With prices of $5000 and $10,000 (exact prices have yet to be announced), most people won’t think the ability to create the perfect dessert is worth that kind of price. Never fear; because most at-home cooks don’t need to create sugary objects up to 8 by 8 by 6 inches in size, Liz Von Hasseln told us that 3DSystems will eventually develop a smaller ChefJet targeted toward the average consumer.</p> \n<p>The ChefJet isn’t the first 3D printer to print edible objects. There are several printers that can print in pure chocolate, and a Barcelona-based startup is currently developing a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tomsguide.com/us/printing-food-3dprinter-pizza,news-17969.html\">printer that can create ready-to-cook pizzas</a>, chicken nuggets and pasta called the Foodini.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.space.com/21250-nasa-3d-food-printer-pizza.html\">NASA is also looking into a pizza-printing 3D printer</a>&nbsp;for use in space.</p> \n<p><em>Email&nbsp;</em><a href=\"mailto:jscharr@techmedianetwork.com\"><em>jscharr@techmedianetwork.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;or follow her&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jillscharr\"><em>@JillScharr</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104694419552620786135/?rel=author\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.&nbsp; Follow us&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomsguide\"><em>@TomsGuide</em></a><em>, on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Tomsguide\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>and on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113097864502537730990/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.&nbsp;<br></em></p> \n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">Best Headphones 2014</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.tomsguide.com/us/3d-printer-buyers-guide,news-17651.html\">3D Printer Buyers’ Guide</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.tomsguide.com/us/3d-printing-changing-etsy,review-1834.html\">How 3D Printing is Changing Etsy</a></li> \n</ul>\n<p>Copyright 2014&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tomsguide.com/\">Toms Guides&nbsp;</a>, a TechMediaNetwork company.

Without the movement, it’ll get only 3 miles of juice on a seven-hour charge, before the gas engine needs to kick in.</p> \n  <p>While the car is being tested on streets now, engineers have more to figure out. For example, the carport is set up to be flat, making it vulnerable to weather.</p> \n  <p>&quot;We’ve got to figure out snow, we’ve got to figure out rain,&quot; Tinskey said. &quot;We know we’ve got more work to do.&quot;</p> \n  <p>Also on display is Toyota’s hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, called FCV for now. It will go on sale next year in the U.S. With a battery that uses hydrogen stored in a 5-kilogram (11-pound) tank and oxygen that rushes in through the front grill, the electric engine vehicle can get 300 miles while only emitting water and water vapor.</p> \n  <p>The main issue for eco-friendly owners will be finding enough hydrogen refueling stations to drive a decent range. California has approved $200 million in funding to build 20 fueling stations by 2015 and 100 by 2024. Toyota says as little as 68 stations will support 10,000 vehicles in the state.</p> \n  <p>The car’s hydrogen power source is harvested in a chemical process involving natural gas. It is already being used in industrial processes like oil refining, and there are pipelines zig-zagging beneath major cities like Los Angeles, said Jared Farnsworth, senior engineer of powertrain system control for Toyota in North America.</p> \n  <p>With hydrogen prices expected to be about $6 to $10 per kilogram — equivalent to $30 to $50 to fill Toyota’s FCV — there won’t be much savings for owners used to getting hybrid vehicle mileage, especially because the car is expected to be priced from $50,000 to $100,000 when it goes on sale next year. But the Earth might thank them later.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div> \n <div>\n  <em>Reporting by Ryan Nakashima</em>\n </div>

The Brick: Startup FINSix Introduces World's Smallest Laptop AC Adapter, Weighs Just 0.1 Pounds","summary":"Due out later this spring, the FINSix 65-watt adapter will come with connectors for all the leading brands of PC laptop, even sporting Lenovo’s new flat connector.","body":"<p><img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/EZbWFt9Rge43D-i4d0sV-oZD8M0\"></p> \n<p><em>(Image: freshnessmag.com)</em></p> \n<p>Move over power brick; there’s something leaner. Here at CES 2014, tech startup FINSix showed off its upcoming 65 watt power adapter, which weighs just .1 pounds and is about a third to a quarter the size of a typical laptop charger. Due out later this spring, the FINSix 65-watt adapter will come with connectors for all the leading brands of PC laptop, even sporting Lenovo’s new flat connector.</p> \n<p>The brainchild of former MIT graduate students who developed a way to process power in a much smaller space during their PHD program, the FINSix 65-watt adapter is just 2.4 cubic inches — approximately 2 inches long, an inch wide and less than inch thick (precise measurements were not available at press time), only a little bigger than a typical phone charger. When we placed itnext a Lenovo AC adapter, it looked like the FINSix could fit inside the regular laptop adapter three or four times. Better still, the FINSix plugs directly into the wall rather than forcing you to dangle another cable between the brick and the power socket.</p> \n<p><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/all-day-strong-longest-lasting-notebooks\">10 Laptops with the Longest Battery Life</a></strong></p> \n<p>Available in several attractive colors, including pink, brown and dark blue, the FINSix adapter also has a USB charging port which hangs off of its cord, allowing you to charge your phone while you power your laptop. You can even use it as a standalone phone charger when it’s not connected to your laptop.</p> \n<p>Considering that a typical power brick weighs half a pound and some weigh even more than that, the FINSix AC adapter could be a huge deal for frequent travelers looking to lighten their loads. After all, what good is having a lightweight pound laptop if you have to carry it around in the same bag with a heavy adapter. FINSix hasn’t decided on a final MSRP, but company CEO Vanessa Green said the adapter would be in the $100 price range or slightly lower. That estimate may seem pricey when compared to universal laptop AC adapters from competitors like Targus, which charges $69.99 for its solution, which can be found for as low as $30 online. However, if you want to a breakthrough product that will make your mobile life easier, FINSix 65-watt could be well worth the cost.</p> \n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/ces-2014-day-1\">CES 2014 Day 1: Top 7 Stories</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/top-10-tech-trends-of-2014\">Top 10 Tech Trends of 2014</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/top-10-notebooks-now\">Top 10 Laptops Now</a></li> \n</ul>\n<p><em>Copyright 2014&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.laptopmag.com/\">LAPTOP Magazine</a>, a TechMediaNetwork company.

Its 13.3-inch E-Ink Pearl screen has a resolution of 1600 x 1200-pixels, and can display up to 16 shades of gray. It also has capacative sensors, so you can swipe left or right to switch pages, much like other eReaders powered by the same technology.</p> \n<p>Also built into the DPT-S1 is an inductive digitizer, which can be used in conjunction with the included stylus to annotate pages. In our hands-on time, the display was fairly responsive in recording our scribblings. It also has 4GB of internal storage, plus an SD card slot, Wi-Fi, and should last up to a month on a charge.</p> \n<p>About 1,000 of these eReaders were sold in Japan at the end of last year, and Sony is looking at selling them in the U.S. later this year.

In addition to the usual suspects, like Fitbit and Jawbone, LG is debuting the Life Band, Sony has the Smart Band – but all of these companies are starting to realize that accurate technology is only half of their business.","body":"<p>You’ve seen fitness bands that track your steps, count your calories, and clock your mileage. But at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), fitness and health monitors have taken over more floor space than ever, with well over a hundred companies presenting new devices claiming to improve your well-being, <em>and</em> that of your kids – even your dog.</p> \n<p><strong>Fitness as Fashion </strong></p> \n<p>It seems like every company is jumping on the “band” wagon, offering Bluetooth-connected, wristband fitness trackers. In addition to the usual suspects, like Fitbit and Jawbone, LG is debuting the Life Band, Sony has the Smart Band – but all of these companies are starting to realize that accurate technology is only half of their business. The other half is embedding the technology in designs that people actually want to wear. So <strong>Sony’s Smart Band</strong> (no price yet) comes with a removable Core, which you can place into different colored bands to match your workout outfit of the day – or even put it into a stylish pendant. The <strong>Shine</strong> ($99) from Misfit Wearables looks like an ethereal watch, and is also available as a necklace.</p> \n<p><strong>No Longer Tied To Your Wrist</strong></p> \n<p>Of course <strong>Google Glass</strong> now has a fitness app, but what interests me more is the integration of fitness monitors into devices you might actually want with you when you’re working out – like your earbuds. LG will be releasing its <strong>Heart Rate Headphones</strong> this spring (no price yet). In the past, you needed to wear a chest strap to get heart rate info, so this is a really smart advancement for those of us who want lots of workout data. In addition to tracking your pulse, distance, and calories burned you can use the device to, why yes, listen to music even when you’re not exercising.</p> \n<p><strong>Don’t Forget to Charge Your Basketball</strong></p> \n<p>Some of the most dramatic innovations in fitness tracking aren’t even worn on your body. The <strong>94Fifty connected basketball</strong> ($299) contains six sensors that combine data to track arc, spin, and force when you shoot and dribble. The Bluetooth connection relays the information to your iOS device, and provides immediate suggestions for how to improve your shot. In my case, after just one shot, it suggested I increase my arc. Next shot – <em>SWISH! </em>Three times in a row!</p> \n<p>Similarly, the <strong>Babolat Play</strong> connected tennis racket ($399) tracks your forehand to backhand ratio, spin, first serves made, etc. Devices like these encourage you to share results with friends for friendly (or unfriendly) competition, and to strive for your personal best. Gamifying is the word the industry uses here, and for sports it makes sense “How does a numeric assessment of my game compare to Rafael Nadal’s?” On second thought “How does my game compare to other 43 year old moms around the country?”</p> \n<p><strong>Not Just for Grownups</strong></p> \n<ul>\n <li>The <strong>ibitz activity trackers</strong> ($35) attach to your kids’ sneakers and link to an app where parents can set goals and rewards for steps taken – rewards like credits and content on Club Penguin.</li> \n <li>The <strong>Mimo onesie</strong> ($199 for three onesies and one interchangeable monitor) tracks your baby’s breathing patterns, body temp, and sleep.</li> \n <li>And for your dog. <strong>Voyce</strong> ($299, plus $15/month) is a collar that records activity, heart rate, and calories burned. Because your dog doesn’t quite have a voice of his own.</li> \n</ul>\n<p><strong>Value in More Gadgetry?</strong></p> \n<p>As Yahoo Tech’s new editor-in-chief David Pogue puts it, “It’s not that all these monitoring devices somehow turn you into an athlete. But by constantly displaying what a sedentary couch potato you are, it puts it in front of mind. You park farther away. You take the stairs. You get off one subway stop earlier. It really works. It’s a psychological trick more than a technological one.”</p> \n<p>Hey, it works for me- I’m off to rack up another 10,000 steps walking around CES.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bworley\">Follow me</a> on Twitter to see what I find.</p>","videos":[{"width":250,"height":140,"embed":"<iframe src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/upgrade-everybody-dog-fitness-tracker-161648038.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false\" width=\"250\" height=\"140\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>"},{"width":400,"height":225,"embed":"<iframe src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/upgrade-everybody-dog-fitness-tracker-161648038.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>"},{"width":500,"height":281,"embed":"<iframe src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/upgrade-everybody-dog-fitness-tracker-161648038.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>"}],"leadImages":[{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":98,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":113,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":141,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":169,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":197,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":225,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":253,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w500/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":281,"size_type":"500"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w550/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":550,"height":309,"size_type":"550"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w600/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":338,"size_type":"600"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w640/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":640,"height":360,"size_type":"original"}],"lead_image":{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w640/7dedaab26a0ad23bfe8b59ffb0e08a8a62d011fb","type":"image/jpeg","width":640,"height":360,"size_type":"original"}},{"id":"72715617887","magazine":"tech","priority":"normal","palette":["#ee803d","#d85e39","#b8997a","#dc8957","#b66440"],"author":{"id":"alyssabereznak","name":"Alyssa Bereznak","title":"Tech Columnist","bio":"Alyssa Bereznak is a professional internet user with over 10 years of experience, some of which were spent at Vanity Fair.

I can say that because I have almost been run over on my bike while trying to read <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/alrVBbHlAI/\">the smudged directions I wrote on my hand.</a></p> \n<p>It wasn’t fun.</p> \n<p>CycleNav clips to the front of your bike and flashes lights to communicate directions. It works like this: Before you hop on your bike, open the device’s Android or iPhone app and plan your route. Then send that route to your little travel companion via Bluetooth.</p> \n<p>As you travel, CycleNav will both blink green lights at you and yell directions so you know which way to turn. It doesn’t connect to headphones for safety reasons, but if you miss anything, you can press a button and it will repeat the last thing it said. It also tracks your progress like a fitness app, so you can compare rides and see whether you’ve become faster or slower. And, <em>sigh,</em> you can be a terrible human being and brag all about your bike ride on Twitter or Facebook. (Please don’t, it makes me feel fat).</p> \n<p>Schwinn says it’ll last for 10 full hours of riding. And it’ll only set you back $60, much less than the value of your life.</p> \n<p>You’ll be able to get one at select retailers like Walmart <a

Here are some of the things you missed.</p> \n<p><strong>Glasshole sitings:</strong> We counted 21 people wearing a $1500 pair of Google-powered spectacles. Next time, before going out in public wearing one of those things, try saying “OK Glass, Google ‘self respect.’”</p> \n<p><strong>Number of men wearing porkpie hats at a jaunty angle so they could pretend they were members of the rat pack:</strong> Five, or roughly five too many.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Grooviest new gadget:&nbsp;</strong><iframe height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/js9jYvJYsTA\" width=\"640\"></iframe>The Dualo, an electronic musical instrument that you wear around your neck and whose music can be controlled both by tapping on the little circles or leaning and back and forth, via motion sensor.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Most egregious abuse of a Thomas Edison invention:</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, I know that there is such thing as electricity, and I know you can wield it to make your sign bright and flashy. But, <em>for the love of god: </em>reel it in. Chances are the majority of journalists who walk by your giant, disco ball of a booth have been staring at screens for the past three days. If anything, your horrible light show will make us move faster away from your booth. Also, it’s not even Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Most confusing outfit in Las Vegas:</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/RWA7pBTAaBs2lCirplPS4QcQ0gU\"></strong></p> \n<p>Why is this poor man covered in tablets and being paraded around the floor like a show pony?

The last thing I want to do is cover it in a case that looks like it’s been vomited on by Paris Hilton.</p> \n<p><strong>Most enigmatic marketing slogan:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.changhong.com/\">Changhong</a>, a Chinese contract manufacturer that recently started selling its own branded HDTVs, had the phrase “LOHAS, my dream” plastered all over its booth. WTF? Turns out that’s an acronym for “Lifestyle Of Health And Sustainability.” We liked it better when it was a mystery.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/xgjjsPZ3QHY28mWVdvZEL_mchNk\"></p> \n<p><strong>Dumbest question in response to an enigmatic marketing slogan:</strong> The Changhong booth featured a mini-pagoda, signs written in Mandarin, HDTVs showing Chinese cooking videos, and a 12-foot-wide scale replica of the eco-friendly “smart city” in China where its headquarters are located. So, naturally, a show attendee approached one of the company’s representatives and asked, “Lohas, is that Spanish?”</p> \n<p><strong>Most distressing idea for soda addicts:&nbsp;</strong>This Aullor soda fountain, which is affixed to a tablet and displays how many calories you’re dispensing as you dispense them, and also tells you how long you would have to run to burn all of that soda off. Maybe I’ll stick with water?</p> \n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/A-PWVAPuIiPbi_jgaINu4Bj3NkI\"></p> \n<p><strong>Greatest single technological innovation:</strong> The invisible mute button on the touchscreens found in the back of every Las Vegas cab, &nbsp;all of which were showing the same three commercials for local attractions hosted by the <a href=\"http://lasvegasmagazine.com/2012/03/31/adrianna-costa/\">buxom-yet-irritating Adrianna Costa</a>. (Hint: It’s in the upper right corner. You’re welcome.)</p> \n<p><strong>Coolest booth on the show floor (literally):</strong> <a href=\"http://www.liquipel.com/\">Liquipel</a>, which makes water-proof coatings for mobile devices, featured an actual rain storm in its booth, dropping the ambient temperature in the overheated South Hall by a good five degrees. Show attendees were relieved; the electronics in the surrounding booths, not so much.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/OWPbkup6xo6uZfx8cJBdeYYvrrY\"></p> \n<p><strong>Most embarrassing booth babe costume:</strong> The competition for this award was intense, but our vote goes to the two women who were forced to wear costumes made from shredded paper to advertise <a href=\"http://www.internationalpaper.com/apps/hammermill/web/index.html\">Hammerill’s</a> wireless printing services. Good thing they weren’t next to the Liquipel booth or we might have had to call in the vice squad. &nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Least persuasive product endorsement:</strong> <a href=\"http://weathersphere.com/\">WeatherSphere</a>, an app that combines GPS navigation with live weather maps, featured the following endorsement on a placard in its booth at Eureka Park: “I would be dead if it wasn’t for this app” – iTunes user Gamer Tag weedy bird. Because if weedy bird likes it, you know it must be awesome.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/_bw9tCvH94XvIP-jAtT0J1554AE\"></p> \n<p><strong>Cutest idea:</strong> <a href=\"http://teddytheguardian.com/\">Teddy The Guardian</a>, above,&nbsp;allows doctors to measure the temperature, pulse, and blood oxygen levels of toddlers by asking them to squeeze the bear’s hand, which contains a sensor and Bluetooth to beam that information to a computer. No matter howling kids as you attempt to stick a thermometer in them. Aww!</p> \n<p><strong>Most useful free giveaway:</strong> <a href=\"http://pckeeperlive.zeobit.com/\">PC Keeper</a>, a computer repair and security company, was giving away multicolored condoms in its booth. Because some things — like STDs — really should stay in Vegas.</p> \n<p><strong>Number of attendees who traveled thousands of miles to attend CES but spent most of their time at the show staring down at their phones:</strong> Nearly all of them.</p>","leadImages":[{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":117,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":133,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":167,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":200,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":233,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":267,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":300,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w500/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size_type":"500"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w550/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":550,"height":367,"size_type":"550"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w600/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":400,"size_type":"600"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w700/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":700,"height":467,"size_type":"700"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w800/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":800,"height":533,"size_type":"800"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w900/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":900,"height":600,"size_type":"900"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1000/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":667,"size_type":"1000"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1100/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":1100,"height":733,"size_type":"1100"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1200/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":1200,"height":800,"size_type":"1200"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w3500/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":3500,"height":2333,"size_type":"original"}],"lead_image":{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w3500/d9170e36b90d56b45ba6d08bfdc2a1ddac5afc94","type":"image/jpeg","width":3500,"height":2333,"size_type":"original"}},{"id":"72839003078","magazine":"tech","priority":"top","palette":["#d8af9c","#815152","#93999c","#060505","#f8f8f7"],"tags":[{"name":"pogue

It waited for me to say something it could respond to, like “Make it five degrees warmer.” Deep down, I know it understood what I meant.</p> \n<p>We are nearly finished connecting everyone to the Internet, save for the 20 percent or so who’d rather just watch TV. But we have only just begun to connect everything else. Many predict that within a few years most of the devices inside our homes and our cars, as well as the ones we wear on our bodies, will be connected to each other via something called the Internet of Things.</p> \n<p>If you haven’t encountered that phrase before, get used to it. You’ll be hearing a lot about the Internet of Things here and elsewhere over the next few years. The IoT could change our lives in ways even the people creating it haven’t imagined yet. Some of the changes will be wicked cool, others scary.</p> \n<p><strong>Machines 1, People 0</strong></p> \n<p>In my house, the Internet of Things has already arrived, mostly in the form of devices that maintain a running dialogue with my smart phone. For example, when our sweet-but-dimwitted dog Hoover bursts through the electronic fence and goes to visit his four-legged friends in the neighborhood, the <a href=\"http://www.pettracker.com/\">Tagg GPS tracker</a> attached to his collar sends me a text message. If I want to find out where the little scamp has been, I can map his route on the Tagg Web site. Did our other dog, the obstinately intelligent Mason, open the front door again to let Hoover out and the cat in? My <a href=\"http://www.vivant.com\">Vivant</a> home security system sends me a text for that too, and lets me relock the doors with a click.</p> \n<p>When my 17 year old arrives home from school suspiciously early, claiming that his Latin teacher told him they had nothing to do that day (as if), I get a text alert. No, I did not attach a Tagg tracker to his collar (though I have been sorely tempted.) But I do have an <a href=\"http://www.mycar-connection.com/\">Audiovox Car Connection</a> plugged into the computer of his ancient minivan, which sends me a text whenever he leaves home and arrives at school, or vice versa.</p> \n<p>And we have not one but two connected thermostats, the Nest and the <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/tech/a-quick-review-of-the-honeywell-voice-control-72118980132.html\">Honeywell WiFi Smart Thermostat</a>, which allow me to control the temperature of my home from thousands of miles away.</p> \n<p>But sometimes these things can get a little too chatty. Last night, after our Internet kept cutting in and out during a windstorm, our Skydog Smart WiFi Router sent me 14 texts between the hours of 1 and 3 am warning me about “network connectivity issues.” Then there’s the Spotter sensor on my living room wall, which alerts me every time it hears a loud noise, sees a bright light, or detects motion. It’s like having the world’s most neurotic roommate on speed dial.</p> \n<p>I have now reached the point in my life where the text messages I receive from machines outnumber the ones I get from humans. That is perhaps a comment on how pathetic my social life has become. But it’s nothing compared to what’s coming next. In a few years, machines will cut us small-brained humans out of the equation entirely. By the year 2020, machine-to-machine communications will dwarf <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/technology/talk-to-me-one-machine-said-to-the-other.html?_r=0\">person-to-person interactions</a> on the Internet, according to Swedish tech giant Ericsson. And these gizmos will largely be chattering to each other on our behalf.</p> \n<p>The classic scenario: On your commute home, your car sends a signal to your WiFi network to crank up the heat, adjust the lighting, cue up your favorite tunes, tell the oven to defrost and cook that pot roast you popped into it that morning, and order your robotic bartender to mix a batch of martinis just the way you like them.</p> \n<p>The technology to do this is already here (yes, even the <a href=\"http://monsieur.co/\">robot bartender</a>.) Today, though, consumer electronics companies have to convince Joe and Jane Consumer to add these devices to their home networks. Eventually they’ll be built into the walls and floors of our homes and the dashboards of our cars. Constant connectivity will be like plumbing and electricity, something we only think about when it doesn’t work.</p> \n<p><strong>When Things Go Bad</strong></p> \n<p>The Internet of Things has already changed my family’s life, mostly for the better. We’re able to track down our wayward canine before the dogcatcher does. The Car Connection not only helps us locate our son, it also gives us feedback on how good a driver he is (better than his father, it turns out). The Skydog router is easily the best home network management tool I’ve ever seen. We never have to return home because we left the AC on or a door unlocked. And that’s not even scratching the surface of the benefits that connected medical devices, utility meters, and other smart “things” will ultimately bring.</p> \n<p>But there’s also a dark side to the Internet of Things few people talk about. Every time you introduce a new connected device you increase the chances that bad guys will find a way into your life, notes Paul Ferguson, who heads up the threat intelligence team for security firm Internet Identity (IID).</p> \n<p>IID predicts that by 2015, hackers will be able to “provoke chaos inside your home, burning your house down by hacking your oven to flood your house with gas and ignite it,” and other terrifying scenarios. On the other hand, two years ago IID predicted someone would be <a href=\"http://internetidentity.com/news/?id=427\">murdered via the Internet</a>, thanks to a hack attack on a connected medical device. We are still waiting for the first body to drop, or for the new CBS cop show “CSI: Internet.”</p> \n<p>Still, if cybercriminals can lock up your data and demand ransom for it – as we saw <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/video/cryptolocker-holding-digital-life-ransom-181300812.html\">with the Cryptolocker malware</a> last fall – what’s to stop them from holding your HVAC hostage in the dead of winter? Or hacking your security system to burglarize your home? If there’s a way to abuse your personal devices to make money, digital thieves will find it.</p> \n<p>Another big concern is what happens to the mounds of data that connected devices will produce about who you are and what you like to do. Somebody somewhere would probably pay to find out which brand of vodka our robotic bartender is pouring, or what irresponsible pet owners we are. If there’s a way to abuse your personal data to make money, digital marketers will find it.</p> \n<p>The debate over how to handle security and privacy on the Internet of Things has barely gotten started, but the devices are already coming by the truckload. &nbsp;As consumers, we need to be fully aware of the IoT’s pitfalls before we hand our lives over to it.</p> \n<p>On that topic, my thermostat is mute. But I’m pretty sure it agrees with me.</p>","leadImages":[{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":102,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":117,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":146,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":175,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":204,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":233,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":262,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w500/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":292,"size_type":"500"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w550/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":550,"height":321,"size_type":"550"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w600/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":350,"size_type":"600"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w700/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":700,"height":408,"size_type":"700"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w800/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":800,"height":466,"size_type":"800"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w900/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":900,"height":525,"size_type":"900"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1000/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":583,"size_type":"original"}],"lead_image":{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1000/f9f980c849507ec21e8f5ddfd774b337a4a5e414","type":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":583,"size_type":"original"}},{"id":"72750563653","magazine":"tech","priority":"top","palette":["#d5bc97","#b39575","#836b54","#134658","#3e3022"],"tags":[{"name":"best of ces","count":33,"slug":"best-of-ces"}],"url_slug":"how-smart-is-it-to-set-up-a-smart-home-72750563653","makelive_date":1389291753551,"ts_update":1389291755,"ccm_id":"a9c14a41-a652-3d8f-a4d4-47a4a126945a","page_date":1389291753550,"attribution":{"display_name":"Rafe Needleman","url":{"href":"http://twitter.com/rafe","rel":"alternate","type":"text/html"}},"image_sizes":[{"type":"ORIG","sizes":[{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":116,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":133,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":166,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":199,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":232,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":266,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":299,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w500/dd372d0932b7dfe25e87f5168ac5eb3d0f3b8a2e","type":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":332,"size_type":"original"}],"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/original/4jGi4CHyxbd4NLBkcOx8Yjf0RHk"}],"highlight_color":"#000000","type":"story","title":"How Smart Is It To Set Up A Smart Home?","summary":"The demo of a smart home from Alex Hawkinson was about the biggest I’ve ever seen.

It took up a whole house. Alex, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.smartthings.com/\">SmartThings</a>, walked me from room to room in a large Las Vegas home as the house reacted to his presence. In the kitchen, it turned on the coffee maker and announced the weather forecast through a <a href=\"http://www.sonos.com/\">Sonos</a> speaker. It even set the <a href=\"http://www.meethue.com/en-US\">Philips LED lightbulbs</a> to various colors based on how well his stock holdings were doing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With the SmartThings system, everything, including devices not made by SmartThings (like the Sonos, the Philips lightbulbs, and other devices) is visible and controllable from your phone — even when you’re not inside.</p> \n<p>As we simulated walking outdoors, a vibration sensor triggered, setting the Sonos to play a recording of a large, angry dog barking to scare away a possible thief. In the garage, opening the overhead door gave us an alert on our smartphone. Also in the garage, dribbling water on a sensor, simulating a leaking pipe, caused a valve to cut off the water supply in to the house.&nbsp;<br><br> And then the moving of an artifact (a ceremonial sword) in the office sent an urgent theft alert to his phone.&nbsp;<br><br> Finally, Alex set the home to “night mode” by pressing the sleep button on his fitness bracelet. The lights all went off, as did the entertainment system, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nest.com\">Nest thermostat</a> dropped to nighttime levels.<br><br> It was cool, Jetsons-style magic. I wanted this gear badly. But really, who <em>needs</em> all this stuff? Who’s going to construct this kind of a system?&nbsp;<br><br> More importantly: Is it worth it? Hawkinson said we were walking through a few thousand dollars worth of equipment. That is less money than anything like this would have cost a few years ago, and it did more cool stuff. With SmartThings software it looked easy to set up.</p> \n<p>But still: A lot of it felt like a science experiment.<br><br> Hawkinson did agree to a point, but he said that some of the monitoring technology (like the leak detection and alerting) was actually really cheap insurance, and people who owned cabins or the like would see the value. Also, he said, this system could be used to tell parents when a kid comes home safely. You don’t need to go all Internet coffee machine to get value from a smart home .<br><br> He also thinks that smart and cheap(ish) sensors, plus technology like his to make sense of their signals, could make home security smarter and more affordable. Equipped homes could know much more about who’s in them and what they’re doing there, leading to fewer false alarms and thus more rapid and automated police dispatch when there are break-ins.&nbsp;<br><br> The challenge when evaluating this smart home stuff is sorting out the useful (alarms that can help you keep your family or your things safe) from the silly (like lighting that adjusts to your mood based on what your fitness bracelet senses). A lot of the demos smashed the sane and the silly together. You’ll want it all. But you only need very little of it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>I’m Rafe Needleman, the new guy on the Yahoo Tech team.

These vehicles are powered by an electric motor and high-voltage battery that is charged by a fuel cell system which produces only water as a byproduct. The result is a car that has a range in line with (or better than) a traditional gasoline engine, but releases no harmful pollutants and can be refueled in just minutes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are still significant challenges that must be conquered before hydrogen powered vehicles show up at your local car dealer, however. Cost of the fuel cell technology must be feasible for consumer level pricing, a refueling infrastructure will need to be much more widespread, and due to the water generated by the fuel cells, operation in sub-zero climates is still a challenge.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Solar</strong></p> \n<p>The sun delivers an immense amount of power to our planet every day in the form of solar energy, but aside from specialized, lightweight racing vehicles, solar power hasn’t made much of an appearance in the modern automotive landscape. The Ford C-MAX Solar Energi Concept is a first for the industry, and its ability to completely break free from the energy grid makes it an exciting harbinger of things to come.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The C-MAX Solar Energi Concept utilizes custom solar panels spread across the vehicle roof in concert with a magnifying canopy that concentrates the sun’s rays to recharge the car’s electric battery. This means that areas without an advanced electrical infrastructure could still utilize the vehicle’s gas-saving features without issue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cars are evolving in a way never seen before, and we’re no longer beholden to fossil fuels to get us from point A to point B. If you’re in the mood for a change, you don’t need to look far, and as we move further into our automotive future your options will only continue to grow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>","leadImages":[{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":113,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":130,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":162,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":195,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":227,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":259,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":292,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w500/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":324,"size_type":"500"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w550/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":550,"height":357,"size_type":"550"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w600/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":389,"size_type":"600"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w700/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":700,"height":454,"size_type":"700"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w800/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":800,"height":519,"size_type":"800"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w900/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":900,"height":584,"size_type":"900"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1000/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":649,"size_type":"1000"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1100/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":1100,"height":713,"size_type":"1100"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1200/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":1200,"height":778,"size_type":"1200"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w2626/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":2626,"height":1703,"size_type":"original"}],"lead_image":{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w2626/e78495056d92a46037d2a00f20b318d175e5baf9","type":"image/jpeg","width":2626,"height":1703,"size_type":"original"}},"2":{"id":"a72775309722","magazine":"tech","priority":"normal","tags":[{"name":"best

These vehicles are powered by an electric motor and high-voltage battery that is charged by a fuel cell system which produces only water as a byproduct. The result is a car that has a range in line with (or better than) a traditional gasoline engine, but releases no harmful pollutants and can be refueled in just minutes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are still significant challenges that must be conquered before hydrogen powered vehicles show up at your local car dealer, however. Cost of the fuel cell technology must be feasible for consumer level pricing, a refueling infrastructure will need to be much more widespread, and due to the water generated by the fuel cells, operation in sub-zero climates is still a challenge.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Solar</strong></p> \n<p>The sun delivers an immense amount of power to our planet every day in the form of solar energy, but aside from specialized, lightweight racing vehicles, solar power hasn’t made much of an appearance in the modern automotive landscape. The Ford C-MAX Solar Energi Concept is a first for the industry, and its ability to completely break free from the energy grid makes it an exciting harbinger of things to come.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The C-MAX Solar Energi Concept utilizes custom solar panels spread across the vehicle roof in concert with a magnifying canopy that concentrates the sun’s rays to recharge the car’s electric battery. This means that areas without an advanced electrical infrastructure could still utilize the vehicle’s gas-saving features without issue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cars are evolving in a way never seen before, and we’re no longer beholden to fossil fuels to get us from point A to point B. If you’re in the mood for a change, you don’t need to look far, and as we move further into our automotive future your options will only continue to

Photovoltaic cells (PVC) are installed on the car to collect and convert solar energy into electric energy. Made of silicon and alloys of indium, gallium and nitrogen, the semiconductors absorb light and then release it, creating a flow of electrons that generate electricity.</p> \n<p>The first solar car was introduced in 1955 at a Chicago auto show. It was 15 inches long, featured 12 PVC cells and was called the Sunmobile. Its solar-power-operated, 1.5-volt motor turned the driveshaft and transferred the energy to propel the wheels.</p> \n<p>Seven years later, the first full-size solar-powered car, a 50-year-old Baker, was unveiled as a concept car. But it was never mass-produced. Numerous other solar-powered cars, some with odd names like Bluebird and Quiet Achiever, had their moments of fame in auto shows and competitions.</p> \n<p>In more recent years, several Japanese and American carmakers have also introduced solar-powered hybrid cars. The concept-only vehicles have ranged from using solar power to run accessories to cells installed inside headlights. In the mid-1980s, Mazda’s solar offering was the Senku, while Ford unveiled the Reflex and Cadillac had the Provoq.</p> \n<p>None of the manufacturers’ solar-powered cars made it to the public. And likewise, the ambitious French-made Venturi Electric, which combined a solar-, wind- and battery-powered engine, didn’t make it. The Venturi held only three passengers and had a maximum speed of 30 mph.</p> \n<p>Transforming concept solar cars into publicly available solar cars poses a few questions. How does the car travel at night? Is the solar car only feasible in states where the sun shines a majority of the time? Ford aims to solve these issues with the introduction this week of the C-MAX Solar Energi Concept

It’s the fear of running out of power and being stuck miles from the nearest charging station.</p> \n<p>According to a survey conducted by the Consumer Electronics Association, the industry trade organization in Arlington, Va., 71 percent of respondents said range anxiety is a concern when considering purchasing an electric vehicle.</p> \n<p>And it’s warranted. With more than a dozen mainstream manufacturers offering the electric-only vehicles, mileage range varies from 11 to 265. The average daily mileage per car in the United States is 36.5 for urban-based vehicles and 48.6 for rural-based vehicles, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p> \n<p>But concerns about range anxiety shouldn’t be a deal breaker. If you’re considering an electric vehicle, consider the opinion of John Kalb.</p> \n<p>&quot;Range anxiety is only a prepurchase condition. Once you drive for a few weeks, any range anxiety is replaced by range confidence,&quot; said Kalb, founder of EV Charging Pros, an independent electric vehicle-charging consulting service in Novato, Calif.</p> \n<p>&quot;Once you drive an EV for any length of time, you know the boundaries. The other reality is people are now buying the EV that matches their driving patterns,&quot; Kalb said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For current EV owners, improving the driving experience is not too dissimilar from gas-powered driver consumers seeking improvement. Common sense, preparation and more conservative driving are key. Consider the following:</p> \n<p>1. Planning and familiarizing trip routes via&nbsp;charging station locations via a smartphone app (PlugShare and CarStation, for example) is an ideal way to start an EV drive. In addition, many EV apps feature images and customer reviews.</p> \n<p>2. Speed hurts&nbsp;in many ways, including draining electric batteries faster than advertised. Maintaining a steady speed and abiding by speed limits (or going a little slower than the limit) will help preserve&nbsp;charge range.</p> \n<p>3. Know your route. Gas-powered cars are more likely to run out of gas when the driver gets lost. Ditto for EV drivers and electricity. A map, smartphone or navigation system can help prevent wrong turns and thus alleviate battery drain and range anxiety.</p> \n<p>4. Electric vehicles generally require less maintenance than gas vehicles. But properly inflating and rotating tires as well as following the vehicle’s manual recommendations in other areas are paramount to a safe, anxiety-free drive.</p>","leadImages":[{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w175/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":175,"height":117,"size_type":"175"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w200/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":133,"size_type":"200"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w250/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":250,"height":167,"size_type":"250"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w300/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":200,"size_type":"300"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w350/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":350,"height":233,"size_type":"350"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w400/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":400,"height":267,"size_type":"400"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w450/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":450,"height":300,"size_type":"450"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w500/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size_type":"500"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w550/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":550,"height":367,"size_type":"550"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w600/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":400,"size_type":"600"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w700/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":700,"height":467,"size_type":"700"},{"url":"http://l2.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w800/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":800,"height":533,"size_type":"800"},{"url":"http://l3.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w900/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":900,"height":600,"size_type":"900"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1000/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":667,"size_type":"1000"},{"url":"http://l1.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1100/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":1100,"height":733,"size_type":"1100"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1200/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":1200,"height":800,"size_type":"1200"},{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w3456/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":3456,"height":2304,"size_type":"original"}],"lead_image":{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w3456/bb656aafe8a0f510b8a7f32280f71ea70908eebb","type":"image/jpeg","width":3456,"height":2304,"size_type":"original"}}],"showcaseData":{"bg_image":"/images/ads/tech/showcase-bg.png","text_color":"#ffffff","logo":"/images/ads/tech/showcase-logo.png","logo_offset_top":160},"tag_info":{"tag":{"name":"Best of CES","slug":"best-of-ces"},"blurb":"The best gadgets, gizmos and ideas from 2014's biggest tech show.","bg_image":"/images/ads/tech/showcase-tag-bg.png","bg_tile":true,"text_color":"#ffffff","logo":"/images/ads/tech/showcase-logo.png","logo_offset_top":115,"bonus_tags":[]}}}};
